## Hey, I'm Anandu S👋

I build things that solve real problems.

Apps, tools, systems—anything that starts as a rough idea and becomes something people actually use.
I believe the best products are simple, thoughtful, and make life a little easier.

### What I'm Building

Currently working on:

- **[Reindeer](https://tryreindeer.com)** — Cursor for databases. An AI-powered SQL workspace that
  understands your schema and generates production-ready queries.
- **[Nodal](https://getnodal.space)** — No-code form backend that turns simple submissions into
  automated workflows.
- **[Mocket](https://mocket.vercel.app)** — AI-powered mock API platform for faster development and
  testing.

These started as small experiments and grew into real products that people use every day.

### Experience

I'm currently a **Software Development Engineer** at
[Keyvalue Software Systems](https://www.keyvalue.systems/), where I've been building scalable
solutions for the past 1.5 years.

Previously, I was an **SDE Intern** at [ClusterDev](https://clusterdev.com/) for 6 months.

### My Approach

I enjoy **learning**, **shipping**, **improving**, and repeating the cycle. My focus is always on
creating solutions that are simple, helpful, and genuinely useful.

I'm always experimenting with new ideas, refining what works, and building in public.

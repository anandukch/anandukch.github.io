Mocket is a smart mock API platform built to help developers move faster. It uses AI to generate realistic mock endpoints instantly, complete with dynamic responses, custom validations, and error simulations that match real-world scenarios.

Designed for frontend, backend, and QA teams, Mocket makes it effortless to prototype, test, and debug without waiting for backend readiness. It adapts to your workflows, lets you shape your own mock behavior, and gives you the freedom to test reliably under any condition — timeouts, validation failures, rate limits, and more.

With a clean interface and seamless integration into your development stack, Mocket keeps you in flow, reducing friction and helping you build with confidence.

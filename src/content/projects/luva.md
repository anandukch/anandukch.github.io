**Luva** is a voice-driven email assistant designed for people who are always on the move. It reads your emails aloud, helps you compose replies using your voice, and handles scheduling through intelligent calendar integration — all without you touching a keyboard.

Built for founders, executives, and busy professionals, Luva turns your inbox into a hands-free experience. You can listen to new emails while multitasking, dictate responses naturally, and let the AI structure them into clear, polished messages. It also organizes and categorizes your inbox automatically so you always stay ahead.

**Luva** focuses on speed, clarity, and privacy, using secure processing and never storing your data permanently. It’s the simplest way to manage email using nothing but your voice.

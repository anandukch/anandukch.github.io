Nodal is a no-code backend that transforms ordinary HTML forms into fully automated workflows. Instead of writing custom servers for every form, Nodal lets you connect your form, design logic visually, and automate everything from storage to email actions — all without touching backend code.

It’s built for anyone shipping fast: developers who don’t want to maintain custom form handlers, marketers who need reliable lead capture, and founders who want workflows that adapt as they grow. With a drag-and-drop workflow builder powered by smart nodes for storage, logic, and actions, Nodal turns broken forms into intelligent systems that capture every lead and scale effortlessly.

At its core, Nodal removes the hidden costs of form infrastructure and lets you launch faster, automate instantly, and move with confidence.

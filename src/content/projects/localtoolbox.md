LocalToolbox is a desktop application that bundles multiple developer and creator tools into one unified, offline-first workspace. Built with Tauri, Rust, React, and Python, it focuses on giving developers fast, local tools without relying on cloud services or external dependencies.

It brings together media utilities, document processing, JSON tools, system utilities, and more — all packaged in a clean, lightweight interface. The Rust backend handles performance, Python scripts power heavy processing, and the React frontend delivers a modern, smooth experience. Everything runs locally on your machine, making it fast, private, and reliable.

LocalToolbox is designed to be extensible and easy to grow: every tool is modular, every workflow is local, and the app scales as you add more capabilities. It’s a simple way to keep your essential utilities in one place — always available, always offline, and always fast.

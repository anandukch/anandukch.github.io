Reindeer is a desktop application that reimagines how developers work with databases. Inspired by editors like Cursor, it brings an intelligent, conversational workspace to SQL—understanding your schema, generating production-ready queries, and refining results as you work.

With natural-language querying, fast autocomplete, and AI-powered fixes, Reindeer lets you explore data, write SQL, and debug effortlessly. Built with Electron and a Node backend, it’s designed for speed, clarity, and a seamless developer flow.

At its core, Reindeer makes databases feel lighter, smarter, and far more intuitive—almost like talking directly to your data.
